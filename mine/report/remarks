avoid subjective statements.
avoid any kind of abbreviations. for example: can’t, I’d,...
avoid the word “I”. Instead, use “we” or write sentences in passive.
regarding the content, distinguish between theoretical and practical issues. Results should be presented and discussed. The topic needs to be introduced first.
if you give a hypothesis or a promise at the beginning, you have to come back at the end and to give an answer.
Please include citations whenever you give a statement. In the “state of the art”-section, this is mandatory. Please also keep in mind that some data sources must be referenced.
Figures should be referred to. Always see yourself in the role of a reader: (s)he needs logical, clearly stated explanations!
Sentences should not be that long. Use short sentences instead.
