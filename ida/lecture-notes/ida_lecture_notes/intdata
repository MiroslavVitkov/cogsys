Types of problems:
- supervised (anotated training data)
- unsupervised (classification, partitioning of data)
- target goal (control system) (chess - you are interacting with the environment and loosing all the time)

regret value = max win - actual win
regulirzors are not created on the training data
guess reg parameters -> train model(1/3) -> evaluate model over evaluation data(2/3) -> construct a better regularizor -> ... -> test on training data(3/3)



cross-validation - used when few data(<1000) is available (use first n points for trining, the rest for evaluation, cycle)

regurlizers - L0 - count of non-zero attributes, not used
L1 - sum of weights - favours sparse models
L2 - sum of squares - no single parameter can be too important

risk - expected value for loss under assumed distribution
