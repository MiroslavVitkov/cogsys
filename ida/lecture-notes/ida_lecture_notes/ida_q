Why class labels -1, +1? - sign() is quite conveninet in exponents in formulas; also when writing the gradient
    if we chose 0 and 1 - we would need an if-then construct in the gradient
Why for maximum a posteriori do we assume a centered prior? - X thita


Exam:
3 questions on all topics on all lectures.
e.g. "how do you learn a decision tree on continuous attributes"
e.g. "how does a random forest work"

Is the mapping fi(x) specified ONLY via the kernel function? Or are they constructed by hand?
  if K is positive semidefinite => exists a fi
  we engineer either fi(x) OR K

ML + L2 regularizer = MAP

Linear regression:
    regression - analytical solution - just multiply some matreces
    classification - no analytical solution - use gradient descent

Logistic regression:
    uses the logistic function (sigmoid)
    can be ML or MAP
