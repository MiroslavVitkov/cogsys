Your Viterbi seems to be incorrect. I think you are just storing the max. probability sequence so far, instead of backpointers – this is not correct, as the maximum probability sequence can completely change at any given time step. I just get „HHHHHHHHHHHHHH“ outputs for longer sequences with your Viterbi. You also do not implement any smoothing methods. Finally, you should actually provide the results (i.e. the evaluation tables). I don't have time to run your code, but I'm assuming the accuracy is rather poor due to the broken Viterbi implementation.
