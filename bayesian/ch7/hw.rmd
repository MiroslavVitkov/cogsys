##7E1  
For each of the causal relationships below, name a hypothetical third variable that would lead
to an interaction effect.  
(1) Bread dough rises because of yeast.  
(2) Education leads to higher income.  
(3) Gasoline makes a car go.  

A:  
(1) temperature  
(2) GDP  
(3) disrepair


##7E2  
Which of the following explanations invokes an interaction?
(1) Caramelizing onions requires cooking over low heat and making sure the onions do not dry out.  
(2) A car will go faster when it has more cylinders or when it has a better fuel injector.  
(3) Most people acquire their political beliefs from their parents, unless they get them instead from their friends.  
(4) Intelligent animal species tend to be either highly social or have manipulative appendages (hands, tentacles, etc.).  

A:  
(1) yes  
(2) no idea  
(3) yes  
(4) yes  


##7E3  
For each of the explanations in 7E2, write a linear model that expresses the stated relationship.

A:  
The dynamics of the system is nonlinear:
$$ P_i = a + b B_i + c C_i + d B_i C_i $$


##7M1
Recall the tulips example from the chapter.
Suppose another set of treatments adjusted the temperature in the greenhouse over two levels: cold and hot.
The data in the chapter were collected at the cold temperature.
You find none of the plants grown under the hot temperature developed any blooms at all, regardless of the water and shade levels.
Can you explain this result in terms of interactions between water, shade, and temperature?

A:  
Hot temperature counters the effects of water and sun on the size of the flowers.


##7M2
Can you invent a regression equation that would make the bloom size zero, whenever the temperature is hot?

A:  
Of course:
$$S_i=0$$
Another answer:
$$S_i = a + b W_i + c S_i + d W_i S_i + e T_i + f T_i W_i + g T_i S_i + h T_i S_i W_i$$
$$T_i = \{0, 1\}$$
$$e = - a$$
$$f = - b$$
$$g = - c$$
$$h = - d$$


##7M3
In parts of North America, ravens depend upon wolves for their food.
This is because ravens are carnivorous but cannot usually kill or open carcasses of prey.
Wolves however can and do kill and tear open animals, and they tolerate ravens co-feeding at their kills.
This species relationship is generally described as a “species interaction.”
Can you invent a hypothetical set of data on raven population size in which this relationship would manifest as a statistical interaction?

A:  
I was undert the impression that the author calls "interactions" the higher order terms in a model.
And the a-priori model is independent from the data, thus no data can "manifest ... interactions".  


Do you think the biological interaction could be linear? Why or why not?  

A:  
What is a "biological interaction"?
Is it linear in terms of which variables?
Anything can be approximated by a linear model with varying degree of success.
